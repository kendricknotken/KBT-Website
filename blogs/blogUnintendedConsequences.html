									<p> During the early days of World War II, four groups of scientists, two in the U.S. and two in Great Britain, were independently working
										 to identify herbicides that could be used to boost production of food crops by eliminating weeds that depleted the soil or crowded out
										  the desired plants <a href="#One">(1)</a>. As the war dragged on, one of the men realized the weedkillers might also have military value.  
										  He proposed that at high doses the herbicides would kill all plants and not just the unwanted weeds. Both governments embraced this 
										  idea and eventually each team of botanists identified the same two chemicals* as the most effective for destroying enemy food crops. 
										  Although the war ended before their discovery could be used <a href="#Two">(2)</a>, less than two decades later, the same chemical combination would be
										  tapped for use in Vietnam. </p>

									<p> In the 1950s, the U.S. sent military advisors, supplies, and money to South Vietnam in an effort to stabilize the troubled democracy.
										 It wasn’t enough. Soon American Green Berets would arrive. Vietnam’s lush rubber trees, expansive rice paddies, and dense, dark green
										  jungles provided ample cover for the enemy. Ambushes were common and deadly.</p>
									
									<p> In 1961, Operation Ranch Hand, the military campaign to destroy Vietnam’s jungles, was initiated <a href="#Three">(3)</a>. Over the next decade millions of
										 gallons of defoliants were used across Southeast Asia. The chemicals were shipped in 55-gallon black barrels with a different color
										  stripe depending on its contents. The most powerful and widely used combination bore an orange stripe and was nicknamed “Agent Orange.”</p>

									<p> Acres and acres of South Vietnam were sprayed with Agent Orange. It destroyed any kind of vegetation and decimated the thick forests 
										that covered much of the country. Although during the war Agent Orange was highly effective in protecting Western soldiers from enemy
										 ambushes, the long-term price would be high. </p>

									<p> Early in the 1960s, the manufacturers of Agent Orange discovered that the product being shipped to Vietnam was contaminated with dioxin.
										 Dioxin is a highly toxic chemical that is known to damage the immune, endocrine, and reproductive systems of humans and other animals <a href="#Four">(4-9)</a>.
										  Studies in mice found that many of the effects of dioxin could be passed down to the next generation <a href="#Ten">(10-13)</a>. Improvements were seen in
										   the third and fourth generations, but these animals did not completely escape the effects of their ancestor’s exposure.</p>

									<p> Agent Orange wasn’t supposed to contain dioxin. It was a by-product of the manufacturing process. Although the problem was identified early
										 on, the solution was time-consuming and expensive and was never implemented. Use of Agent Orange in Southeast Asia continued until 1972
										  when knowledge of its harmful effects could no longer be ignored <a href="#Four">(4)</a>.</p>

									<br>

									<p> Decades later, the path of Agent Orange’s destruction winds through generations. Multiple types of cancer, heart disease, diabetes,
										 dementia, and numerous other conditions are more common in men who served in Vietnam compared to those who didn’t <a href="#Fourteen">(14)</a> <a href="#Fifteen">(15)</a>.
										   Their children and grandchildren often suffer with birth defects like spina bifida or missing limbs and are at an increased
										    risk of developing leukemia and other diseases <a href="#Sixteen">(16)</a>. </p>

									<p> The fate of the people in Vietnam has been far worse. Although the U.S. has spent billions of dollars on remediation efforts,
										 many parts of the country remain contaminated with dioxin and may never be the same. Millions of Vietnamese civilians were
										  exposed during the war, and because of the contamination of the water and land, their exposure didn’t stop when the spraying ended.
										   Serious diseases, stillbirth, and preterm birth are frequently observed <a href="#Seventeen">(17)</a> <a href="#Eighteen">(18)</a>. Far too many children suffer with one or more
										    severe birth defects. Multiple missing or misshapen limbs, blindness, and mental disability are common <a href="#Four">(4)</a> <a href="#Eighteen">(18)</a>.</p>

									<p> Since the original scientific studies that led to the development of Agent Orange were conducted during World War II,
										 the U.S. and British governments placed a temporary moratorium on publication of the work. The delay each group faced
										  in being able to report their findings ultimately led to uncertainty over which team of scientists should receive credit
										   for the discovery of the chemicals that came to be known as Agent Orange <a href="#Two">(2)</a>. Nearly 80 years later there is no dispute
										    regarding the unintended consequences of their work. Although I cannot speak for these men, my guess is that if they were 
											still alive today they would be devastated by <br> the death and destruction their work produced and would likely be grateful 
											for the uncertainty <br> surrounding who among them deserves the credit for it.</p>
									
									<p> <strong> Notes: </strong> </p> 

									<p> *2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were the herbicides used for Agent Orange.
										It was unintentionally contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or, more commonly, dioxin). </p>
