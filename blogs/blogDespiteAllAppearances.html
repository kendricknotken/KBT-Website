										<h2> Despite All Appearances </h2>
									</header>

										<strong>  </strong> </span> </p>

									<p> Growing up in small-town Mississippi, my family was poor.  Not food-stamp poor, but after my parents divorced
										and my dad walked away—our financial situation left a lot to be desired.  My mom worked two jobs to keep a
										roof over our heads and food on the table, but designer shoes and the latest fashions were never an option.
										My sister Leana and I were teenagers at the time and we both worked after school.  We didn’t have to help
										with the household bills, but if we wanted something new or something “unnecessary,” we had to pay for it
										ourselves.  All these years later, the days of financial struggle are long behind us. My sister and her
										husband own a successful construction company, I was recently promoted to professor at the medical center
									    where I work, and my mom, at 75, still works.  Not because she has to, but because she wants to keep busy.
										However, the difficult years led all three of us to become quite talented at being frugal. To this day my
										sister can walk into any discount clothing store and walk out with the most amazing find.  This is the
										backdrop to the story I wish to tell. </p>
									
									<p>
										A few years ago, after moving into my new house near Nashville, Tennessee, my mom and sister drove up from
										Mississippi to help with the unpacking.  Normally, they would come in my sister’s truck, but it was in the
										shop again largely because my sister refused to by a new one.  She had the money (she and David always pay
										cash for vehicles because they “don’t do credit”), but my sister liked the way that money looked in her savings
										account.  So, instead of my sister’s vehicle, they opted to drive my mom’s car.  Now my mom desperately (in mine
										and Leana’s opinion) needed a new car.  Hers was 20 years old and looked every day of it.  The paint was peeling, 
										the leather seats were peeling, and the headliner was coming apart.  But “the engine is just fine” my mom would say
										and steadfastly refused to by a car.  Did I mention she worked at a car dealership?
									</p>

									<p>
										After spending several days at my new house cleaning and unpacking, their visit was coming to a close.  My mom needed
										 to get gas and my sister wanted to check out the new Goodwill store that had just opened nearby (still frugal, of course).
										   At the gas station, my sister decided to buy a lottery ticket since they don’t sell them in Mississippi and “she could
										    do a lot of good with that kind of money”.  At the register, she noticed a nicely dressed gentleman and his very young
											 son buying a gas can.  Even at 50-something my sister is beautiful when she puts an effort into her appearance.  This
											  was not one of those days.  On top of that, while 25 years in Nashville has moderated my southern drawl, my sister,
											   spending most of her life in Mississippi, not so much.  She probably looked and sounded very much like a down-on-her-luck
											    redneck when she said, “Did y’all run out of gas?”  Well, duh, the nicely dressed man probably thought, but he just said,
												 “yes, almost made it, but had to leave my truck at the Walgreens and we walked over.”  If you know Leana, you also know
												  that she insisted we take them back to their car.  You don’t win an argument with my sister.  We all piled into my mom’s
												   “the engine is just fine” car and headed toward the Walgreens, my sister at the wheel.  Leana asked what kind of truck
												    he had and, discovering they both drove the same kind, she proceeded to tell the man that hers was a lot older and in
													 the shop. She said she probably needed to get a new one but didn’t want to spend the money.  There is no doubt in my
													  mind he thought the only way she would have the money to buy much of anything was if that lottery ticket was winner,
													   but he just smiled and nodded.
									</p>

									<p>
										We arrived at his truck and we all got out of my mom’s car to say our good-byes.  The nicely dressed man pulled out a $20 bill
										 and tried to give it to my mom.  All three of us laugh so hard we were in tears.  We didn’t need the money, despite all appearances.
										   The man was confused—he was trying to be kind and we did look just this side of destitute.  My mom was the first one to pull it
										    together and very kindly said thank you, but no.  He insisted.  She insisted.  Finally, she quoted scripture.  Something about
											 doing good for the sake of doing good and not for your own benefit (I am not as familiar with the good book as my mother thinks
											  I should be, otherwise I would probably remember the verse she quoted).  The man just looked at her blankly, not knowing what
											   to do.  She said, “surely, you would not deny us the gift of helping you?”  Okay—what can he say to that?  He put his money
											    away, thanked us again, picked up his child and bolted. 
									</p>

									<p> 
										We all piled back in my mom’s car and Leana headed toward the Goodwill, which is right next door to the gas station. No doubt, the
										 destination of the man and his son.  “No,” I said.  “We are not going to let him see us going into Goodwill.  Drive around.  Drive
										  anywhere, but do not stop at the Goodwill.”
