										<h2> Change of Course </h2>
									</header>

										<strong>  </strong> </span> </p>

									<p> I moved to Nashville, Tennessee, more than 30 years ago because I was ready for
										something different. I had grown up in a small town in Mississippi and wanted to see
										what city living was like. Although there wasn’t a job waiting for me, a friend was willing
											to let me stay with him until I found something. </p>

									
									<p> A lot has happened since then. Graduate school, marriage, children, career, divorce,
										novelist. It hasn’t always been easy, but it’s never been boring. Moving to Nashville was
										the right decision for me way back when, but times have changed. Once again, I began
										craving something different. I even began toying with the idea of leaving medical
										research. Although I have loved my scientific career, the stress of juggling a laboratory,
										fighting for funding, and shouldering the ever-increasing administrative burden had me
										careening toward burnout. Some days I wanted to walk away and never look back—but
										how could I leave when there were still so many unanswered questions? I wanted to
										find a way to slow down but still contribute to medicine and science. </p>

									<p> <span class="image right"><img src="../images" alt="" /> 
										<strong> </strong> </span> <p></p>

									<p> The answer to my dilemma came in an email when yet another colleague asked me to
										help them work out some kinks in a research paper they had written. Over the years, I
										had helped quite a few friends write or polish their grants and papers. Unlike many
										scientists and physicians, writing is something I enjoy. I began to wonder if I could carve
										out a new career by combining my research expertise with my love of writing. I joined
										the American Medical Writers Association and began the process of establishing myself
										as a freelance medical writer. Somewhere along the way, moving to Mississippi became
										an important part of that process. </p>

									<p> The decision to move back to Mississippi was an easy one for me since my mom and
										sisters were still there. What surprised me was the response I received from friends and
										colleagues when I told them where I was moving. The conversation generally went like
										this:</p>

									<p> <i> “You’re leaving Nashville?” </i></p>

									<p> <i> “Yes.” </i></p>

									<p> <i> “Where are you going?” </i></p>

									<p> <i> “Mississippi.” </i></p>

									<p> This answer was always followed by a long pause and a confused look. After a few
										seconds, their face would clear and they would say, “Oh! You must have family there.” </p>

									<p> It seems no one could comprehend any other reason an intelligent person might want to
										move to Mississippi. It's no secret Mississippians have a reputation for being
										uneducated and culturally backward, but the stereotype is undeserved. We have plenty
										of culture—numerous artists and authors call Mississippi home. And Jackson, our state
										capital, is one of only four cities in the world sanctioned to host the International Ballet
										Competition. Uneducated? Mississippi established the first state system of junior
										colleges in the United States, ensuring more high school graduates could further their
										education.</p>

									<p> While it's true that proximity to family was my primary reason for moving to Mississippi,
										the choice also made sense given my decision to change careers. The cost of living in
										Mississippi is markedly lower compared to Nashville and that made starting a freelance
										writing business far less risky.</p>

									<p> Do I miss Nashville? Of course. But not as much as you might think. Mississippi may
										not have the Smoky Mountains, but the Natchez Trace is practically out my back door.
										We have all the same high-end stores as the rest of the country and Amazon even
										delivers here. Nashville has Music Row, but Elvis was born in Tupelo, and the blues
										were born in the Mississippi Delta. In other words, there’s plenty to see and do here no
										matter what you enjoy. Even so, more often than not, you’ll find me on my patio writing.</p>
