									<p> <strong> Kaylon Bruner Tran </strong> holds a PhD in reproductive pathology and is an active medical research scientist with a laboratory at 
										Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. She is best known for her medical research studies examining 
										endometriosis and the generational effects of environmental toxicant exposure. She is particularly interested in how such 
										exposures may lead to the development of reproductive disease and dysfunction across generations. Much of her research is 
										focused on the effects of dioxin, the chemical contaminant of Agent Orange that has been linked to numerous adverse health 
										effects in veterans, their children, and the population of Vietnam.</p>

									<p> Kaylon was born in Little Rock, Arkansas but grew up in Grenada, Mississippi. She attended Delta State University for her 
										undergraduate degrees and Vanderbilt University for her PhD. After post-graduate studies in Philadelphia (Thomas Jefferson University), 
										she returned to Nashville and joined the faculty at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p>

									<p> Kaylon has always loved writing and throughout her life has written non-fiction essays to help her remember different events in her own 
										life. When her sons were little, she was annoyed that so many cartoons included an evil scientist. In response, she started making up 
										stories about good scientists to tell them at bedtime. And of course, as a scientist, writing and publishing research studies is 
										critical to advancing knowledge as well as one's career. To this end, she has published more than 75 manuscripts and book chapters 
										for medical and scientific audiences. Despite all this, Kaylon had never considered writing a novel until an unexpected personal event. 
										Because her and her ex-husband's heritages were so different, she was curious about her children's DNA mixture. Kaylon submitted saliva 
										samples from her family to AncestryDNA—which led to the discovery of a previously unknown relative who was looking for his biological
										 mother. The story that unfolded became the inspiration for Kaylon's first novel, Time Intertwined. At the time, she thought it would 
										 be the only one she would ever write—but apparently not. The one book has become a trilogy and Kaylon has found a new passion in addition 
										 to being a mom and scientist.</p>
